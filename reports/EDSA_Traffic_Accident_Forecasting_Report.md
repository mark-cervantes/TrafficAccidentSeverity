# EDSA Traffic Accident Forecasting: Summary Report

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to forecast the occurrence of severe traffic accidents on EDSA. A secondary goal is to identify key predictors associated with these severe accidents.

### 1.2. Report Structure
This report outlines the methodology used, from data ingestion and preprocessing to model development, evaluation, and selection. It details the performance of various models, analyzes feature importance, and concludes with a recommendation for the most suitable model for the task.

## 2. Data

### 2.1. Data Source
The data used for this project is the RTA EDSA 2007-2016 dataset, containing records of traffic accidents on EDSA over a 10-year period.

### 2.2. Target Variable
The target variable, `SEVERITY`, is a binary indicator where '1' represents a severe accident (resulting in injury or fatality) and '0' represents a non-severe accident. This was derived based on the `killed_total` and `injured_total` columns.

### 2.3. Key Preprocessing Steps
- **Feature Exclusion:** Removal of outcome-related, identifier, and redundant features.
- **Datetime Engineering:** Extraction of temporal features (hour, day of week, month, year, season, etc.) from `DATETIME_UTC`.
- **Missing Value Imputation:** Handling of missing data for features like `WEATHER` and `LIGHT`.
- **Categorical Encoding:** Conversion of categorical features (e.g., `ROAD`, `MAIN_CAUSE`, `COLLISION_TYPE`) into numerical format using One-Hot Encoding.
- **Numerical Scaling:** (Applied during modeling pipeline) Standardization of numerical features.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1. Modeling Pipeline
A standardized modeling pipeline was established, including:
- Train-test split (80/20, stratified by `SEVERITY`).
- Consistent `random_state` for reproducibility.
- Evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Systematic logging of hyperparameter trials and final model performance to an Excel sheet.

### 3.2. Models Explored
The following classification algorithms were implemented and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- LightGBM
- XGBoost
- Bagging Classifier (with Decision Tree base estimators)
- AdaBoost Classifier (with Decision Tree base estimators)

### 3.3. Hyperparameter Tuning
GridSearchCV was employed for hyperparameter optimization for each model, aiming to maximize the F1-score on the validation sets.

### 3.4. Class Imbalance
Techniques such as `class_weight='balanced'` or `scale_pos_weight` were considered and incorporated into the hyperparameter tuning process for relevant models to address the imbalance in the target variable.
