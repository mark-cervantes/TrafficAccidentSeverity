# Initial Findings on SEVERITY Column

Date: May 13, 2025

This document summarizes the initial analysis of the `SEVERITY` column from the `RTA_EDSA_2007-2016.csv` dataset, as performed in the `notebooks/02_severity_column_analysis.ipynb` notebook.

## 1. Frequency Distribution of `SEVERITY`

After running the `02_severity_column_analysis.ipynb` notebook, please populate the following table with the unique values found in the `SEVERITY` column and their respective counts and percentages.

| SEVERITY Value | Count | Percentage (%) |
|----------------|-------|----------------|
| *Example: Mild*| *1234*| *45.6%*        |
| *Example: Severe*| *567* | *21.0%*        |
| *Example: NaN*   | *10*  | *0.4%*         |
| *(Add more rows as needed based on notebook output)* |

**Observations from Frequency Distribution:**

*   *(Describe any initial observations, e.g., most common severity type, presence and proportion of missing values, any unexpected values, etc. Please replace this text with your findings after running the notebook.)*

## 2. Contextual Inspection of Sample Rows

The `02_severity_column_analysis.ipynb` notebook displays sample rows for each unique `SEVERITY` value.

**Observations from Sample Row Inspection:**

*   **For SEVERITY = '[Value 1]'**: *(Describe any insights gained from looking at sample rows for this specific severity value. For example, are there any patterns in other columns like `killed_total`, `injured_total`, or other descriptive columns that seem to correlate with this severity value? Please replace this text and add sections for each unique SEVERITY value found.)*
*   **For SEVERITY = '[Value 2]'**: *(Observations...)*
*   *(Add more sections as needed for each unique SEVERITY value)*

## 3. Preliminary Conclusions

*   *(Based on the frequency distribution and sample inspection, what are your initial thoughts on the existing `SEVERITY` column? Is it well-populated? Do the values seem intuitive at first glance? Are there immediate concerns about its direct usability as a target variable? Please replace this text with your conclusions.)*
