Here is the consolidated list of the stages in the machine learning process:

1.  **Stage 1: Defining the Problem and Business Goal.**
    *   Clearly define the business problem you're trying to solve.
    *   Identify key stakeholders and their objectives.
    *   Translate the business problem into a specific ML task (classification, regression, etc.).
    *   Define success metrics from a business perspective.
    *   Consider feasibility and potential impact.
2.  **Stage 2: Gathering and Preparing data for ML.**
    *   Identifying and sourcing relevant data (databases, APIs, logs, etc.).
    *   Data collection strategies and challenges.
    *   Data cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, inconsistencies.
    *   Data preprocessing
    *   Data splitting: Training, Validation, and test sets.
    *   Addressing data privacy and security.
3.  **Stage 3 - Model Development & Training.**
    *   Selecting appropriate ML algorithms based on the task and data.
    *   Model architecture design (if applicable, e.g., neural networks).
    *   Hyperparameter tuning
    *   Training the model on the training data.
    *   Using techniques to prevent overfitting.
4.  **Stage 4 - Model Evaluation & Selection.**
    *   Evaluating model performance using relevant metrics (aligned with business goals).
    *   Comparing different models and their performance on the validation set.
    *   Performing error analysis to understand model weaknesses.
    *   Selecting the best model for deployment based on relevant criteria.
